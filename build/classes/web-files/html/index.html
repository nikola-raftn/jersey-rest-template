            This is the landing page located withing the /src/web-files/html directory. <br>
            Feel free to change it. <br><br>
            If you wish to add more pages to the web app structure, you can do that by adding new .html files to the 
            'html' folder, and calling them via the HtmlService.getInstance().get("pageName") method in the PageNavigationService class.

            <br><br>

            If you wish to create your own custom objects, do it by extending the 'Entity' class. <br>
            Every class can have its own Data Access Object (DAO), with custom access methods. <br>
            You can do that by extending the 'EntityDAO' class <br>
            Or by simply instantiating 'EntityDAO&lt;MyClass&gt;, if you don't need anything more complex than the basic CRUD methods.
            
            <br><br>
            
            If you want to modify your database from the client, you should to it by creating a new custom REST class, in the 'services.rest' package, and extending 
            the 'DatabaseRestService' or 'RestService' class. <br>
            RestService class provides only a ServletContext object, and you have to implement the rest yourself. <br>
            DatabaseRestService comes with small DAO/Storage setup methods, to avoid writing ugly ServletContext code.<br>
            If you extend the DatabaseRestService, in the 'onCreate' method (which you should annotate with @PostConstruct in order for everything to work properly),
            you should put the following code: <br><br>
                super.setDatabaseAttributeString("myClass");<br>
                if (super.getDAO() == null) <br>
                super.setDAO(new DataAccessService&lt;MyClass&gt;(
                                new MyClassDAO(
                                        new BasicStorage&lt;MyClass&gt;(MyClass.class, "pathToFile"))));
            <br><br>
            What those lines of code above are doing is, they create a new AccessLayer for the REST class to interact with the database. <br>
            DataAccessService serves as a wall to prevent bad data from coming in, by validating every object that tries to come through.
            <br>
            MyClassDAO (or EntityDAO if you wish) holds all your data, but doesn't do any validations, and thus needs a DataAccessService
            around it to prevent bad data from being stored. 
            <br>
            BasicStorage stores all the data from the MyClassDAO in a file at the location you specify. <br>
            Current implementation of BasicStorage is just a conversion from Map to JSON which gets saved as a regular .txt file. <br>
            You can store your files anywhere, as long as you provide the right path to their folder/s.

            <br><br>
            As a sidenote, you don't have to use DataAccessService, if you do not wish to block bad data. <br>
            In that case, just remove the DataAccessService constructor from the code above.
